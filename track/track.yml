  teaser: Using Cypress to navigate a page

      Cypress can navigate a page by first getting a DOM element using its CSS selector
      and then simply performing the `click()` method, like so:
      ```
      cy.get('a.classExample').click() // This clicks a link anchor (a) with class "classExample"
      ```
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      To verify that you've landed on the correct page, you can chain an assertion on 
      another element, for example:
      ```
      cy
      .get('.classExample')
      .click()
      .get('div.contentDiv h1') // The element to assert on
      .should('eq', 'SomeText') // The actual assertion
      ```

    We've placed a *navigate.spec.js* file at *~/cypress/integration* to get you started.

    Modify it to click the *Start learning* button on instruqt.com and check whether we've landed on the correct page
    by asserting that the URL should equal *https://play.instruqt.com/public*

    You can use the *cy.url()* method to get the current URL
