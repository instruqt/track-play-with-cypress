  teaser: Using Cypress to navigate a page
  notes:

    contents: Let's start with navigation
  - type: text
    contents: |-
      Cypress can navigate a page by first getting a DOM element using its CSS selector
      and then simply performing the `click()` method, like so:
      ```
      cy.get('a.classExample').click()
      ```
      This clicks a link anchor (a) with class "classExample".
  - type: text
    contents: "To verify that you've landed on the correct page, you can chain an
      assertion on \nanother element, for example:\n```\ncy\n.get('a.classExample')\n.click()\n.get('div.contentDiv
      h1') // The element to assert on\n.should('eq', 'SomeText') // The actual assertion\n```"
  difficulty: basic
  assignment: "We've placed a *navigate.spec.js* file at *~/cypress/integration* to
    get you started.\n\nModify it to click the **Start learning** button on instruqt.com
    and check whether we've landed on the correct page\nby asserting that the URL
    should equal *https://play.instruqt.com/public*\n\nYou can use the `cy.url()`
    method to get the current URL\n\nRun your new test by clicking *navigate.spec.js*
    in the Cypress tab "
